# CTC filter
A filtered view of c2ctc.com

Currently the c2ctc.com website shows all challenge entries in a single list, combining entries from people of different sexes and different weight classes. What if you only wish to view entries from women? Or from lightweight men?

The CTC filter is a web page that allows you to specify which of the following categories you wish to view:

- Lightweight women
- Heavyweight women
- Lightweight men
- Heavyweight men

You can select several categories at the same time. To view entries from all women, select both the "lightweight women" and "heavyweight women" categories.

The entries displayed by the CTC filter are obtained from c2ctc.com and updated periodically throughout the day.
